Community Detection using the stability of a graph partition.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code implements the stability method as discussed in the articles

"Stability of graph communities across time scales" 
Delvenne, J.-C.; Yaliraki, S. N. & Barahona, M.
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010, 107, 12755-12760 

and

"Laplacian Dynamics and Multiscale Modular Structure in Networks"
Lambiotte, R.; Delvenne, J.-C. & Barahona, M.

For optimizing the stability quality function the Louvain algorithm as described 
in the publication

"Fast unfolding of communities in large networks",
Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre,
Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2008 (10), P10008

is used.
A simple example graph is included in the folder /demo/ that demonstrates the 
main functionality of the program.
As a second example a graph representation of Adenylate Kinase (AdK) as it has 
been used in

analysis: application to the myosinâ€“myosin light chain interaction"
Delmotte, A.; Tate, E. W.; Yaliraki, S. N. & Barahona, M.

Further example graphs that have been used in these analyses are available on 
request. If you make use of any part of this toolbox, please refer to the 
respective articles.
