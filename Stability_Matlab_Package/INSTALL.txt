1) Make sure you have a c++ compiler installed
        - For linux, you can find one here: 
            http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/
        - For windows, you can use Visual C++ express: 
            http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/

2) Make sure mex is properly configured in Matlab:
        - Type "mex -setup" in Matlab, and choose your compiler.

3) Run "Install_Stability" in Matlab
        - If you get an error message concerning the libstdc++.so file, 
            you may want to do the following manipulation:
            $ cd "Matlab_root_directory"/sys/os/glnx86/
            $ sudo mv libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc_s.so.1.back
            $ sudo mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.back
            
        - If you are a Mac user and get an error message concerning 
            malloc.h or any other error. I have not tested this code on a Mac.

4) Type "help stability" in Matlab to discover how to use the code.

5) Try this example to check that everything is working:
    cd('demo');
    load data;
    [S, N, VI, C] = stability(Graph,Time,'plot','v');



NOTES:
------

* The install script adds the bin folder to your Matlab path. 
This will enable you to use stability as a standard Matlab function form 
everywhere. If you don't want that, just remove it from the path by going 
in File/Set Path.

* If you get a warning message concerning savepath, and you want the 
stability code to be in your path, go, after the installation, in 
File/Set Path, and choose "save". Then choose where you want pathdef.m
to be saved. If at the next matlab startup, you notice that stability is
not in your matlab path anymore, try editing/creating the "startup.m" file
from your matlab user folder (type userpath to know where it is located)
and add the following line: addpath(' path to bin folder of stability 
package ').

* If you want to speed up the calculations, you might consider adding the
option 'noVI', when computing the stability. This will disable the 
calculation of the variation of information, which is usually slow at small
Markov times, when the number of communities found is big. Another option
is to decrease the number of optimisations on which the variation of 
information is calculated. To do so, add the option 'M' and put a value
such that M < L (L is the number of louvain optimisations).
ex: [S, N, VI, C] = stability(Graph,time,'plot','v', 'L', 100, 'M', 10);
