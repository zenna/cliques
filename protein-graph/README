Protein-to-Graph Package

This package contains a collection of scripts that together automate 
the process of converting from a Protein Data Bank *.pdb file to a
graph adjacency file understood by the stability package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
File descriptions:

fullrun.sh:
in an ideal world this is the only script that needs to be
called. It will set up a temporary working directory, call a GROMACS
energy minimisation, use FIRST to find all the covalent and non-
covalent bonds, and run Stefano's MATLAB script for the actual graph
generation.

gromacs-emonly.sh:
Directs the various energy minimisations called by GROMACS.

gromacs.sh:
Obsolete version of the gromacs script that also does a short MD
simulation in addition to the energy minimisation. No longer used.

*.mdp:
Default parameters for the various GROMACS calls.

pdb2adj.orig/:
Does the actual conversion of the output from FIRST to a graph

community_highlight.py:
Not actually that related. Just a set of pymol visualation scripts that
are provided for figure generation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous notes:
* Newer versions of GROMACS do not provide the opslaa force field.
  This is very bad, because it'll require a significant amount of re-
  writing in the pdb2adj.orig MATLAB scripts to parse the GROMACS top-
  ology file. Additionally, some of the minor conversions in the shell
  scripts in this directory might get broken. For now, recommend stick-
  ing with the older versions of GROMACS (~4.0.7).

* The parameter "MAXDIM" in each of the adjacency.m files in the pdb2adj
  directory that *must* be larger than the size of the graph (the number
  of nodes). However, if it is set *too* high, then the graph conversion
  will take a very long time because of unnecessary memory operations.

  For now, it is sufficient to manually set MAXDIM just a couple hundred
  higher than the size of the graph each time. Automation would actually
  be trivial, but no one's gotten around to it yet (just do a sed on the
  copies of the scripts in the working directories after getting the
  sizes of the graphs).
